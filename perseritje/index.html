<h1><strong>Owls</strong></h1>

<p>
Owls can hear sounds that humans can’t.
Their ears are placed asymmetrically (one higher than the other), which helps them figure out exactly where a sound is coming from, even in total darkness.
Some owls can hear a mouse moving under snow or leaves!

<p>Owls have huge eyes that let in lots of light — perfect for seeing in the dark.
Their eyes are so big that they can’t move them around like humans do, which is why they have to turn their heads instead.</p>

<p>The edges of their feathers are shaped to reduce noise when they fly.
This makes them almost completely silent, so their prey doesn’t hear them coming.</p>
